**More about this evaluation tool:** 

Data is not fully objective. Human choices or circumstances of a research environment will always create limitations that contextualize or frame the content that is gathered. Data that are complete as possible (de-identified as needed, information that cannot be shared is excluded; any necessary supporting information is included, such as: data codebooks, READMEs, protocols, or other documentation) and well described increases reuse value, because we must be able to understand the conditions for which data was orginally gathered to be able to make our choices for how or when to reuse it.

This tool is meant to assist the evaluation of research data for reuse in a research context or for others to better understand and contextualize research data, such as: research data that is housed or preserved at various kinds of data repositories. Research data may take many forms, such as (but not limited to): datasets, images, code, databases, geospatial files, documents.
